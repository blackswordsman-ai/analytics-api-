# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version is
#   checked in to source control, so users of your package can use the same version of Python
#   as you. However, for a generic project, you probably don't want to check them in.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#1255, lock files should be placed under source control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if you don't want to check in the lock file,
#   uncomment the following line.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipenv, poetry.lock should be checked in to source control.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipenv and Poetry, pdm.lock should be checked in to source control.
# pdm.lock
#   pdm build plugins may create files in .pdm-build/
.pdm-build/
